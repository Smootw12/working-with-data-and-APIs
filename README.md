# working-with-data-and-APIs

Here I learned about data fetching and APIs many years ago and i dove into the world of web development. 
I learnd this right after the p5.js @Daniel Shiffman's introduction to Javascript so it was like making magic to me âœ¨.
Before i had the p5 course i was introduced to programming with Unity and C# that was a little too hard for a 13 y/o boy 
but i got the most out of it and i learned about OOP and programming concepts in general so it was easier for me to grasp on
the web dev course and follow along with the concepts.
